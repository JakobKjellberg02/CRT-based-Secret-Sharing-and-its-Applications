# CRT-based-Secret-Sharing-and-its-Applications
The project focuses on understanding CRT-based secret sharing (SS) and implementing applications where this type of SS has a pivotal role. In particular, it studied the performance of the weighted encryption schemes when they are implemented using CRT-SS
